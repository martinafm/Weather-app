## Description

I used free [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/) to create this project. I wanted the user to be able to search in this app by typing in a location. This kind of searching is still available for use and described [here](https://openweathermap.org/current#geocoding), but unfortunately that API requests by city name, zip-codes and city id have been deprecated.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- JavaScript
- JSON
- free API
- Font Awesome Icons

## Features
